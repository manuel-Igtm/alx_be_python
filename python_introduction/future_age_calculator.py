#Practice receiving user input in Python and perform a simple arithmetic operation to calculate the userâ€™s age in a future year.
# Prompt the user to input their current age
current_age = int(input("How old are you? "))
# Calculate the age in 2050
age_in_2050 = current_age + 27 # 2050 - 2023 = 27
#print result
print(f"In 2050, you will be {age_in_2050} years old.")
