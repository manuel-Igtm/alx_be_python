#Apply basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the simple interest on a given principal amount, rate of interest, and time.
principal = 1000
rate = 0.05
time = 3
# Calculate simple interest using the formula: interest = (principal * rate * time)
interest = principal * rate * time
print("The simple interest is:",interest)
